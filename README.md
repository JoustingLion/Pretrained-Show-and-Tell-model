## Generating Captions

# Steps
0) Follow the steps at [im2txt](https://github.com/tensorflow/models/tree/master/im2txt) to clone the repository, install bazel, etc.
1) Download the model checkpoint:

2) Clone the repository:
git clone [https://github.com/KranthiGV/Pretrained-Show-and-Tell-model.git](https://github.com/KranthiGV/Pretrained-Show-and-Tell-model.git)

```
# Path to checkpoint file.
# Notice there's no data-00000-of-00001 in the CHECKPOINT_PATH environment variable
# Also make sure you place model.ckpt-1000000.index (which is cloned from the repository)
in the same location as model.ckpt-1000000.data-00000-of-00001
CHECKPOINT_PATH="/path/to//model.ckpt-1000000"


# Vocabulary file generated by the preprocessing script.
# Since the tokenizer could be of a different version, use the word_counts.txt file supplied. 
VOCAB_FILE="/path/to/word_counts.txt"

# JPEG image file to caption.
IMAGE_FILE="/path/to/image.jpeg"

# Build the inference binary.
bazel build -c opt im2txt/run_inference

# Run inference to generate captions.

  --checkpoint_path=${CHECKPOINT_PATH} \
  --vocab_file=${VOCAB_FILE} \
  --input_files=${IMAGE_FILE}
